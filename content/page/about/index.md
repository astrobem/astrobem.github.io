AstroBem is a place where all students from our school can expand their horizons, working on astrophysics and astronomy. Our group was created by our physics teacher Anna Krzyczkowska. We are located in Milanówek, Masovian Voivodship.

We started operating in July 2022 taking part in an experiment called “Obserwacja Nieba”. It consisted of noting the trajectory of the Sun's movement in the sky over 6 months, using camera obscura. Right after that, our facilitator found out about the CanSat contest, which we are still working on today.

In our first year of the CanSat competition, we decided to study the thrust and inertial force during a rocket flight and investigate the effect of these forces on the pressure and temperature sensors. It was quite a tough year for us, because of our debut. Our hard work resulted in a trip to the national finals to the Lesser Poland voivodship. Our can-sized satellite was launched by a rocket and all measurements were successful. We managed to get a distinction from the jury after presenting our final results.

This year, we are also trying in the CanSat contest, counting on qualifying for the final second time or maybe advancing to the European finals to represent our country. 

Here’s our main personnel:
* Anna Kryczkowska
*	Jan Gołąb
*	Maksymilian Domański
*	Wiktor Plawgo
*	Jan Kaczmarek
*	Jan Michalak
*	Adrian Wołowski
